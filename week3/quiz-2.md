## Question 2
Suppose you ran logistic regression twice, once with λ=0, and once with λ=1. One of the times, you got
parameters θ=[74.81 45.05], and the other time you got θ=[1.37 0.51]. However, you forgot which value of
λ corresponds to which value of θ. Which one do you think corresponds to λ=1?

### Answer
* **θ=[1.37 0.51]**
* θ=[74.81 45.05]
