# Quiz: Neural Networks: Learning

## Question 1
You are training a three layer neural network and would like to use backpropagation to compute the gradient of the cost function. In the backpropagation algorithm, one of the steps is to update

$$ \Delta^{(2)}_{ij} := \Delta^{(2)}_{ij} +  \delta^{(3)}_i * (a^{(2)})_j$$
